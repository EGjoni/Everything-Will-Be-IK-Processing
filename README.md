# Everything-Will-Be-IK-Processing

This project serves as both a Processing extension of the robust java Inverse Kinematics library <a href="https://github.com/EGjoni/Everything-WIll-Be-IK">Everything Will Be IK</a>, and an official reference for anyone looking to port or extend EWBIK for their own purposes.

<b>Features:</b>
<ul>
<li>Orientation AND position based targets (6-DOF).</li>
<li>Highly stable.</li>
<li>Multiple end-effector support</li>
<li>Intermediary effector support.</li>
<li>Dampening (stiffness control).</li>
<li>Highly versatile 3-DOF constraints with arbitrarily shaped orientation regions.</li>
</ul>
</br>


<b>Installation Instructions:</b></br>
<ol>
<li>Download a .zip from this repository.</li>
<li>Locate your processing sketchbook folder. (You can find this from within the Processing IDE by clicking File -> Preferences).</li>
<li>Navigate to that sketchbook directory.</li>
<li>Extract the ewbIK folder into the 'libraries' folder within your sketchbook.</li>
</ol>
The final directory layout should look something like

```
..sketchbook/
  ┣ libraries/
    ┣ ewbIK/
      ┣ doc/
      ┣ examples/
      ┣ library/
      ┣ src/
```
